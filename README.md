## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Kubernetes: [Install Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- kubectl: [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- MongoDB: [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run the Bookstore application.

### 1. Build and Push Docker Image

Build and push the Docker image for the Python Flask application.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t yourusername/bookstore-app:latest .

# Push the Docker image to a container registry (replace 'yourusername' with your Docker Hub username)
docker push yourusername/bookstore-app:latest
```

### 2. Launch MongoDB Instance

Launch a MongoDB instance. If you have MongoDB installed locally, you can start it with:

```bash
mongod
```

If using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo:latest
```

### 3. Deploy Python Application on Kubernetes

Use the provided Kubernetes YAML files to deploy the Python application and MongoDB service.

```bash
# Apply Kubernetes Deployment and Service files
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f app-service.yaml
```

## Usage

Access the Python Flask application at [http://localhost](http://localhost) or the IP address of your Kubernetes cluster. The application provides endpoints for managing books, genres, and more.

## Configuration

- **MongoDB Configuration**: The MongoDB URI is set in the `app.py` file. Update it according to your MongoDB instance.

- **Docker Configuration**: Update the `image` field in the `deployment.yaml` file with your Docker image name and tag.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or usage, refer to the [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) guide for common solutions.
